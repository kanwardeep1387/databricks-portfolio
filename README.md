Learning Databricks, ML/AI, and GenAI step by step
# Databricks ML/AI/GenAI Roadmap

This repository documents my complete **learning and project journey** with Databricks, covering all stages from fundamentals to advanced Generative AI.

The goal is to:
- Build a **solid foundation** in Databricks and the Lakehouse architecture.
- Gain hands-on expertise in **Data Engineering, ML/AI, and AI Applications**.
- Advance into **Generative AI** with Databricks (LLMs, RAG, fine-tuning, LLMOps).
- Create a **professional portfolio** of projects and notebooks for certifications and career growth.

## 📌 Phases of Learning

### 🔹 [Phase 1 — Fundamentals](phase1_fundamentals/README.md)
- Lakehouse architecture (Bronze–Silver–Gold).
- Delta Lake (ingestion, time travel, schema evolution, optimization).
- Unity Catalog for governance and permissions.
- Databricks SQL queries and dashboards.
- ETL pipelines (batch + basic streaming).
- **Certification target:** Databricks Data Engineer / Analyst Associate.

---

### 🔹 [Phase 2 — ML/AI Foundations](phase2_ml_ai_foundations/README.md)
- Train ML models with Spark MLlib and AutoML.
- Track experiments and manage models with MLflow.
- Reusable features via Feature Store.
- Deployment & monitoring with Model Registry.
- MLOps lifecycle in Databricks.
- **Certification target:** Databricks Machine Learning Engineer.

---

### 🔹 [Phase 3 — AI Applications](phase3_ai_applications/README.md)
- Apply ML models into real-world business systems.
- Fraud detection, recommendation engines, predictive maintenance.
- NLP basics with text classification.
- Model APIs, dashboards, and automation.
- Drift monitoring & retraining.
- **Certification target:** Databricks Professional (Data Engineer or ML Engineer).

---

### 🔹 [Phase 4 — Generative AI](phase4_generative_ai/README.md)
- Large Language Models (LLMs: DBRX, LLaMA, GPT).
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with vector search.
- Fine-tuning LLMs using MosaicML.
- LLMOps for LLM lifecycle management.
- AI governance with Unity Catalog.
- **Certification target:** Databricks Generative AI Engineer.
