Learning Databricks, ML/AI, and GenAI step by step
# Databricks ML/AI/GenAI Roadmap

This repository documents my complete **learning and project journey** with Databricks, covering all stages from fundamentals to advanced Generative AI.

The goal is to:
- Build a **solid foundation** in Databricks and the Lakehouse architecture.
- Gain hands-on expertise in **Data Engineering, ML/AI, and AI Applications**.
- Advance into **Generative AI** with Databricks (LLMs, RAG, fine-tuning, LLMOps).
- Create a **professional portfolio** of projects and notebooks for certifications and career growth.
